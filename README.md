# Diabetes_HospitalReadmissions

Hospital Readmissions related to chronic conditions such as Diabetes are large in volume, they're high-cost, and in many cases, potentially preventable events. Readmissions are increasingly being used as a quality measure to improve discharge processes at hospitals, as well as brings attention to the complexity of care required by patients having a chronic condition and co-morbidities. 

This is a personal project by Shambhavi Kumar to take a data-driven approach in identifying risk factors leading to readmissions for Diabetes patients. While the project is work-in-progress, this script covers the data wrangling and preparation process for later stages of model-building.
